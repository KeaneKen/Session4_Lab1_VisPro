aight so this reame includes a reflection about this lab sesh

The first difference is app state is more global, shared across the application, and needs robust management
while ephemeral state is more local to a single widget and typically managed with the widget's internal State object
(basically app state is for the entire app, meanwhile ephemeral state is only for singular widget)
